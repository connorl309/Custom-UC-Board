# Custom 32-bit ARM Microcontroller Board
This project is my attempt at designing and fabricating a custom PCB for the [TMPM46BF10FG](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Toshiba/TMPM46BF10FG?qs=wd5RIQLrsJi6ktKViwPiDg%3D%3D), developed by Toshiba. It is rich in features, and while not a very beginner friendly chip to work with, satisfies a lot of my requirements in finding a great UC to use.

## The Board
The board itself is originally starting out as a 2-layer board. I will be trying to be aware of EMI and signal degradation effects, but due to me being a student, I don't have tons of cash to throw around on multilayer boards if I mess something up.  
A few of my core goals are as follows.

* Ease of access to GPIO and special function pins: not restricting their access or usage.
* Ease of use for the board overall: accessibility of peripherals, pin input and outputs, and uploading programs to the UC.
* Smart layout choices: can an end user easily identify their required pins, and understand board functionality.
* Does it feel *good* to use? (I hope so!)

This is my first foray into real PCB design, and I'm excited to display my progress on this project here.
